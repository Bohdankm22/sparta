This document contains details that are only relevant for
people inside the SPARTA team at UW.

The source code for the SPARTA checkers is in a Mercurial repository at
/projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/sparta-code

To get a copy do:

$ hg clone ssh://YOURID@SERVERNAME//projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/sparta-code

To push your changes to the repository you need to be in sparta
group. Contact Werner or Mike to get the permission.

(Along with sparta-code, you may be interested in the sparta-meetings
and apac-meetings repositories for general information on the SPARTA
project.)

Note that SPARTA as well as the Checker Framework are evolving
rapidly.
Thus you may need to pull and update with updated source code and
rebuild the projects:

$ hg fetch

Test applications are stored in
/projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/sparta-subjects


Try to run ant in sparta-subjects/Sky 

$ ant flowtest

If it gives results like this, you're ready to work on annotating!
[jsr308.javac] /home/syhan/jsr308/sparta-subjects/Sky/src/org/jsharkey/sky/WebserviceHelper.java:308: error: incompatible types.

If you want to add a new application, put it under the
sparta-subjects directory.

You may need to get Android source code to get sense of what api returns (or
gets) what type of data. See http://source.android.com/source/index.html
You can find the list of all apis from the android source code in 
frameworks/base/api/15.txt - api list for api version 15 (Android 4.0.3)
Accessing resource is closely related to android permissions (some of the
resources are not protected with permissions though). Android permission list
is at:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html
Hints to add annotations could be permissionmap (which permission is required
to call which functions):
http://www.android-permissions.org/permissionmap.html


Adding Annotations
There are two parts in adding annotations. 
Firstly, we need to annotate the flow stub file (flow.astub) in
sparta-code.
It's used for annotating Android APIs. For instance, 

package android.telephony;

class TelephonyManager {
    public @FlowSources(sparta.checkers.quals.FlowSources.FlowSource.PHONE_NUMBER) String getLine1Number();
    public @FlowSources(sparta.checkers.quals.FlowSources.FlowSource.IMEI) String getDeviceId();
}

The above annotates two methods in class TelephonyManager.
It means that the getLine1Number function returns a String which is
phone number.  For more examples, look into the flow.astub file.

FlowSources specifies data sources such as phone number, location, and
etc. FlowSinks specifies sinks, such as files, network, and so on.
The types of FlowSources and FlowSinks are listed in the
FlowSources.java and FlowSinks.java files in sparta.checkers.quals.


The second part is annotating the Android application to match
the annotations specified in the stub file. Run flowtest and see if
any incompatible types are shown and iteratively add more annotations
to the application.
The Android API specifications in flow.astub is currently
incomplete. As you experience new APIs, extend the specifications.
