\chapter{Handling Intents\label{flow-checker}}

Android intents are the standard inter-component communication
mechanism in Android.  They are used for communication within an \app,
among \apps, and with the Android system.  An Android component can
send or broadcast intents and can register interest in receiving
intents.

Intents can be seen as messages exchanged through components; the
payloads of these messages are maps.  Sensitive data can flow in and
out of intent objects.  Consequently, to prevent manifestations of
forbidden flows, \theFlowChecker{} needs to be aware of the
information flow types associated to the various data elements
encapsulated in intent maps.

\TheFlowChecker{} provides support to
ensure that the type of data stored within an intent conforms to the
declared type of the intent, even in the presence of implicit
invocation via intents.  It verifies that for any sending intent
method call and any receiving intent method declaration that can be
invoked by the call site, the intent argument of the caller is
compatible with that of the corresponding callee.  In addition, the
checker verifies that the intent payload is used consistently at each
site.
