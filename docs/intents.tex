\chapter{Handling Intents\label{flow-checker}}

Android intents are the standard inter-component communication
mechanism in Android.  They are used for communication within an \app,
among \apps, and with the Android system.  An Android component can
send or broadcast intents and can register interest in receiving
intents.

Intents can be seen as messages exchanged through components where the
payloads of these messages are maps.  Sensitive data can flow in and
out of intent objects.  Consequently, \theFlowChecker{} needs to be
aware of the information flow types associated to the data
encapsulated in intent maps in order to prevent manifestations of
forbidden flows.
