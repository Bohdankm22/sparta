\chapter{Introduction\label{introduction}}

SPARTA is a research project at the University of Washington funded by the DARPA
 Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) program.


SPARTA aims to detect certain types of malware in Android applications, or
to verify that the app contains no such malware.  SPARTA's verification
approach is type-checking:  the developer states a security property,
annotates the source code with type qualifiers that express that security
property, then runs a pluggable type-checker~\cite{PapiACPE2008,DietlDEMS2011} to verify the type
qualifiers (and thus to verify that the program satisfies the security
property).


%% This feels premature; readers don't know why or what parts of the
%% Checker Framework mnual to read.
% The SPARTA toolset is largely built upon 
% the Checker Framework. 
% For more information on pluggable type-systems, please consult the Checker Framework manual at 
% \url{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/}.  


You can find the latest version of this manual in the sparta-code version
control repository, in directory \<sparta-code/docs>.  Alternately, you can
find it in a SPARTA release at
\url{http://types.cs.washington.edu/sparta/release/}, though that may not
be as up-to-date.
