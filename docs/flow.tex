\chapter{Information Flow Checker\label{flow-checker}}
This chapter describes the Information Flow Checker, a type-checker that 
tracks information flow through your program.
The Information Flow Checker does pluggable type-checking of an information flow type
system.  It is implemented using the Checker Framework.  This chapter is
logically a chapter of the 
Checker Framework Manual (\ifhevea\url{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html}\else\url{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.pdf}\fi).
Therefore, in order to understand this chapter, you should first read
chapters 1--2 of the Checker Framework Manual, and you should at least skim
chapters 18--21 (generics through libraries) and 24--25 (FAQ and
troubleshooting). 



To use the Information Flow Checker, a programmer must supply two types of
information:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A flow policy that expresses what information flows the program is allowed
to have. \todo{Why do we need an example here?}  For example, a program might be allowed to send location
information to the network, but not allowed to access contacts nor to send
SMS messages.  The flow policy is primarily derived from the program's user
documentation.  \secref{sec:flow-policy} describes how to write a flow
policy.
\item
\todo{The user doesn't know what a type qualifier is yet, we called them annotations in the overview}
Type qualifiers written on (some of) the variables in the program.  The
type qualifiers indicate where the variable's value came from and where it
might go to.
\end{itemize}

When you run the Information Flow Checker, \todo{ add reference to section that explains how to run Information Flow Checker}it verifies that the annotations in the
program are consistent with what the program's code does, and that the
annotations are consistent with the flow policy.  This gives a guarantee
that the program has no information flow beyond what is expressed in the
flow policy and type annotations.


\section{Source and Sink annotations\label{sec:flow-type-system}}

The type qualifier \<@Source> on a variable's
type indicates what sensitive sources might affect the variable's value.
The type qualifier \<@Sink> indicates where (information computed from) the
value might be output.
These qualifiers can be used on any occurrence
of a type, including in type parameters, object instantiation, and cast types.


As an example, consider the declaration

\begin{Verbatim}
    @Source(LOCATION) @Sink(INTERNET) double loc;
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The type of variable \<loc> is \<@Source(LOCATION) @Sink(INTERNET)
double>.
The \<@Source(LOCATION)> qualifier indicates that the
value of \<loc> might have been derived from
location information.
Similarly, the qualifier \<@Sink(INTERNET)> indicates that
\<loc> might be output to the network.  It is also
possible that the data has already been output.
A programmer typically writes either \<@Source> or \<@Sink>, but not both, as explained
in  \secref{sec:system:defaults}. 

The arguments to \<@Source> and \<@Sink> are one or more permissions
drawn from our enriched permission system (\secref{sec:permissions}).
The rarely-used special constant \<ANY> denotes the set of all sources or the set of all
sinks.
%Most of them correspond to Android permissions (see 
%\url{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html}),
%and others are new ``permissions'' that provide finer-grained control over
%the behavior of an application.

\subsection{Syntax\label{sec:flow-anno-syntax}}
The source and sink qualifiers are type annotations that can be used on any type use.  They have a single attribute, an array of Strings, that represent the permissions.  The Strings must start with the string value of a constant in the FlowPermission enum; a class with a static string constant, FlowPermissionString, can be statically imported and used for this purpose. They can be optionally parameterized as shown below:

\begin{Verbatim}
PERMISSION(param1, param1)
\end{Verbatim}

Some examples:

\begin{Verbatim}
@Source(FILESYSTEM)
@Source(INTERNET+"(uw.edu)")
@Sink({WRITE_SMS, WRITE_CONTACTS})
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Subtyping\label{sec:subtyping}}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{figures/flowsources}%

\caption{Partial qualifier hierarchy for flow source and flow sink type
  qualifiers, expressed as Java annotations \<@Source> and \<@Sink>.}
\label{fig:flow-hierarchy}
\end{figure}


A type qualifier hierarchy indicates
which assignments, method calls, and overridings are legal, according to
standard object-oriented typing rules.
\figref{fig:flow-hierarchy} shows parts of the \<@Source> and
\<@Sink> qualifier hierarchies.


\<@Source($B$)> is a subtype of \<@Source($A$)> iff \<$B$> is a subset of \<$A$>.
For example, \<@Source(INTERNET)> is a subtype of \<@Source(\{INTERNET, LOCATION\})>.
This rule reflects the fact that the \<@Source> annotation
places an upper bound on the set of sensitive sources that were actually
used to compute the value.
If the type of \<x> contains \<@Source(\{INTERNET, LOCATION\})>, then the value
in \<x> might have been derived from both \<INTERNET> and \<LOCATION> data, or
only from \<INTERNET>, or only from \<LOCATION>, or from no
sensitive source at all.
% XXX

The opposite rule applies for sinks:
\<@Sink($B$)> is a subtype of \<@Sink($A$)> iff \<$A$> is a subset of \<$B$>.
The type \<@Sink(\{INTERNET, LOCATION\})> indicates that
the value is permitted to flow to both \<INTERNET> and \<FILESYSTEM>.  This
is a subtype of \<@Sink(INTERNET)>, as the latter type provides fewer routes through which the information may be
leaked.

\section{Polymorphism \label{sec:polyflowsources}}


Information flow type qualifiers interact seamlessly with parametric polymorphism (Java
generics).  For example, a programmer can declare

\begin{Verbatim}
    List<@Source(CONTACTS) @Sink(SMS) String> myList;
\end{Verbatim}
\noindent
Here, the elements of \<myList> are strings
that are obtained from \<CONTACTS> and that may flow to \<SMS>.

\TheFlowChecker also supports qualifier polymorphism, in
which the type qualifiers can change independently of the underlying type.
This allows a programmer to write a generic method that can operate on values of
any information flow type.
For example, if a method is declared as
\<@PolySource int f(@PolySource int x)>, then it can be called on an \<int>
with any flow sources, and the result has exactly the same sources as the
input.  This can be viewed as a declaration and two uses of a type
qualifier variable.  The implicit type qualifier variables are
automatically instantiated by \theFlowChecker at the point of use.

For brevity,
the additional
annotation \<@PolyFlow> can be written on a class or method declaration to indicate that
all contained parameters and return types should be annotated as \<@PolySource
@PolySink>.  \<@PolyFlow> does not override explicitly-written annotations as explained
in \secref{sec:polyflow}.


Parametric polymorphism, qualifier polymorphism, and regular Java types can
be used together.  The type system combines the
qualifier variables and the Java types into a complete qualified type.

See section ``\ahref{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#qualifier-polymorphism}{Qualifier polymorphism}'' in the Checker Framework Manual.  

\subsection{Receiver polymorphism}

Receiver polymorphism restricts the return and/or parameter qualifier types of a method to be exactly 
the qualifier type of the receiver. 
For example, the StringBuffer append method uses this sort of polymorphism to restrict they type of strings that can be appended.  For example,

\begin{Verbatim}
StringBuffer buffer = (@Source(USER_INPUT) StringBuffer) new StringBuffer();
@Source(READ_SMS) String smsMessage = getSMS();
buffer.append(smsMessage);  // illegal
buffer.append(getUserInput());  // legal
 \end{Verbatim}
 
 Parameters, returns, and receivers are annotated with \<@PolySourceR> or \<@PolySinkR> to indicate this.
 
\section{Comparison to Android permissions\label{sec:permissions}}

The Information Flow Checker's permissions are finer-grained than standard Android manifest permissions
in two ways.  First, Android permits any flow
between any pair of permissions in the manifest --- that is, an Android
program may use any resource
mentioned in the manifest in an arbitrary way.  Second,
\theFlowChecker refines Android's permissions, as
we now discuss.

\TheFlowChecker's permissions are not enforced at run time as Android
permissions are (the latter potentially resulting in an exception during execution).
Rather, they are statically guaranteed at compile time.  Even if an app
inherited a permission from another app with the same sharedUserId, 
\theFlowChecker will require that permission to be listed in the flow policy.   

\subsubsection{Restricting existing permissions\label{sec:parameterized-permissions}}

Android's \perm{INTERNET} permission represents all reachable 
hosts on the Internet, which is too coarse-grained to express the
developer's intention.  \TheFlowChecker allows this permission to be parameterized with a domain name,
as in \perm{INTERNET(``*.google.com'')}.
Other permissions can be parameterized in a similar style in which 
the meaning of the optional parameter varies based on the permission 
it qualifies.
For example, a parameter to \perm{FILESYSTEM} represents a file or
directory name or wildcard, whereas the 
parameter to \perm{SEND\_SMS} represents the number that receives the
SMS\@.

Other permissions that need to be parameterized include 
\perm{CONTACTS}, \perm{*\_EXTERNAL\_FILESYSTEM},
\perm{NFC}, \perm{*\_SMS}, and \perm{USE\_SIP}, plus several of those
described in \secref{sec:new-permissions}, such as \perm{USER\_INPUT} to
distinguish sensitive from non-sensitive user input.

% Examples:  USER_INPUT, ...

\subsubsection{Sinks and sources for additional resources}
\label{sec:new-permissions}

\TheFlowChecker adds additional sources and sinks to the Android permissions.
For example, \theFlowChecker requires 
a permission to retrieve data from the accelerometer, which can indicate the user's
physical activity, and to write to the logs, which a colluding app could potentially read.
\tabref{tab:perms} lists
the additional sources and sinks.
We selected and refined these by examining the Android
API and Android programs, and it is easy to add additional ones.

  \section{Inference and defaults}
 \label{sec:system:defaults}
 
 A complete type consists of a \<@Source> qualifier, a \<@Sink> qualifier,
 and a Java type.  To reduce programmer effort and code clutter, most of the
 qualifiers are inferred or defaulted.  
 
 A programmer need not write qualifiers within method bodies,
 because such types are inferred by \theFlowChecker (see \secref{sec:type-inference}).
 Even for method signatures and
 fields, a programmer generally writes either \<@Source> or
 \<@Sink>, but not both; see \secref{sec:infer-from-flow-policy} and 
\secref{sec:unannotated-types}.

\subsection{Local variable type inference}
\label{sec:type-inference}

A programmer does not write information flow types within method bodies.  Rather, local
variable types are inferred.

We limit type inference to local variables to ensure that
each method can be type-checked in isolation,
with a guarantee that the entire program is type-safe if each method has
been type-checked.  It would be possible to perform a whole-program type
inference, but such an approach would not be modular, would be
heavier-weight, would not deal well with cooperating or communicating
applications, and would provide fewer documentation benefits.  


\subsection{Determining sources from sinks and vice versa}
\label{sec:infer-from-flow-policy}

If a type contains only a flow source or only a flow sink, the other qualifier is
filled in with the most general one that is consistent
with the policy file.
%
If the programmer writes 
\<@Source($\alpha$)>, \theFlowChecker defaults this to
\<@Source($\alpha$)> \<@Sink($\omega$)> where $\omega$ is the
set of flow sinks that all sources in $\alpha$ can flow to.
%
Similarly,
\<@Sink($\omega$)> is defaulted to
\<@Source($\alpha$)> \<@Sink($\omega$)> where $\alpha$ is the
set of flow sources allowed to flow to all sinks in $\omega$.
%
Defaults are not applied if the programmer writes both a source and a
sink qualifier.

For example, suppose the flow policy contains the following:

\begin{Verbatim}
    A -> X,Y
    B -> Y
    C -> Y
\end{Verbatim}
  
\noindent 
Then these pairs are equivalent:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mbox{\<@Source({B,C})>} & = & \mbox{\<@Source({B,C}) @Sink(Y)>} \\
  \mbox{\<@Sink(Y)>}       & = & \mbox{\<@Source({A,B,C}) @Sink(Y)>}
\end{eqnarray*}

This mechanism is useful because oftentimes a programmer thinks about a
computation in terms of only its sources or only its sinks.
The programmer should not have to consider the rest of the program
that provides context indicating the other end of the flow.


An example is the \<File> constructor:
a newly-created readable file should be annotated with
\<@Source(FILESYSTEM)>, but there is no possible \<@Sink> annotation
that would be correct for all programs.
Instead, the \<@Sink> annotation is omitted, and
our defaulting mechanism provides the correct value
based on the application's flow policy.

\subsection{Defaults for unannotated types}
\label{sec:unannotated-types}


\begin{table}
  \caption{Default information-flow qualifiers for unannotated types}
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
  \hline
    \bf{Location} & \bf{Default Flow Type}\\
  \hline
     \<@Source($\alpha$)>&\<@Source($\alpha$)>
       \<@Sink($\omega$)>,  $\omega$ is the set of  sinks allowed to flow from all sources in $\alpha$ \\
     \<@Sink($\omega$)>&\<@Source($\alpha$)>
       \<@Sink($\omega$)>, $\alpha$ is the set of  sources allowed to flow to all sinks in $\omega$ \\
    Method parameters & \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(\{\})>  \\
    Method receivers & \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(\{\})>  \\
    Return types &  \<@Source(\{\}) @Sink(ANY)> \\
    Fields &  \<@Source(\{\}) @Sink(ANY)> \\
    \<null> &  \<@Source(\{\}) @Sink(ANY)>\\
    Other literals & \<@Source(\{\}) @Sink(ANY) >\\
    Local variables &   \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(\{\})> \\
    Upper bounds &   \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(\{\})> \\
    Resource variables  &   \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(\{\})> \\
    All other locations & \<@Source(\{\}) @Sink(\{\})>\\
  
  \end{tabular}

  \label{tab:defaults}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:defaults} shows defaults for completely unannotated types.
\TheFlowChecker allows a developer to choose a different default for a
particular method, class, or package.
When the default is only a source or only a sink, the other qualifier is
inferred from the policy file as explained in
\secref{sec:infer-from-flow-policy}.


As is standard, the \<null> literal is given the bottom type qualifier, which allows it to be assigned to any variable.
For \theFlowChecker, the bottom type qualifier is \srcnone\  \<@Sink(ANY)>.

\subsection{Declaration annotations to specify defaulting\label{sec:additionalanno}}

The Information Flow Checker has additional declaration annotations that are shorthand for common 
annotation patterns on method signatures.   They override the usual defaulting of method declarations.

\subsubsection{@PolyFlow\label{sec:polyflow}}

Annotation \<@PolyFlow> expresses that each contained method should be annotated as \<@PolySource> 
\<@PolySink> for both the return types and all parameters. It should be used to express a relationship 
between the return type and the parameter types, but not the receiver type

\subsubsection{@PolyFlowReceiver\label{sec:polyflowreceiver}}

Annotation \<@PolyFlowReceiver> expresses that each contained method should be annotated as \<@PolySourceR> \<@PolySinkR> for the return type, all parameter types, and the receiver type.  
(If the method or constructor does not have a receiver, then the annotation is treated at \<@PolyFlow>.

\subsubsection{Declaration annotations in stub files\label{sec:declannosstubfiles}}
If \<@PolyFlow> or \<@PolyFlowReceiver> is written on a class or package, then the annotation applies
 to all contained methods or classes unless those classes or methods are annotated with another 
 declaration annotation.   

This change of defaulting happens to library methods that are not written in stub files.  For example, the class
 Integer as been annotated with  \<@PolyFlowReceiver>, but the toString method is not listed in the stub file.  
 This method is inferred to be annotated with  \<@PolyFlowReceiver> and therefore its use will not result in a 
 type error  involving the \<NOT\_REVIEWED> FlowPermission. 
 
 \subsection{Inferring annotations with parameterized permissions\label{sec:infer-param-perms}} 
 
 The declaration annotation @InferParameterizedPermission is used to indicate
that a method's return type should use a parameterized permission, where the
parameter of that permission is derived from the value of a method argument.
The annotation indicates which argument(s) and/or receiver should be used,
which permission should be parameterized,  whether that permission is a source,
a sink or both, and what if any separator should be used to concatenate
multiple arguments.   The value of a method argument is determined using the
Constant Value Checker, which is documented in the Checker Framework Manual.
 
 For example, \begin{Verbatim}
 // stub file:
@InferParameterizedPermission(value=FILESYSTEM, param=1, isA=source)
@Source(FILESYSTEM) FileInputStream(String arg0);

 // source code:
@Source("FILESYSTEM(filename)") FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("filename");
\end{Verbatim}



\section{Warning suppression\label{sec:waringsuppression}}
 
Sometimes it might be necessary to suppress warnings or errors produced by
the Information Flow Checker.  This can be done by using the
\<@SuppressWarnings("flow")> annotation on a variable, method, or (rarely)
class declaration.  Because this annotation can be used to subvert the Flow
Checker, its use is considered suspicious.  Anytime a warning or error is
suppressed, you should write a brief comment justifying the suppression.
\<@SuppressWarnings("flow")> should only be used if there is no way to
annotate the code so that an error or warning does not occur.  

\section{Annotating library API methods in stub files\label{sec:apispecs}}

Annotations for API methods are found in the stub files in sparta-code/src/sparta/checkers/flowstubfiles.
For details, see Section~\ref{flow-task-annotate-apis} of this manual, and also 
chapter
``\ahref{\url{http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#annotating-libraries}}{Annotating
  Libraries}'' in the Checker Framework Manual.  
 The methods that appear in stub files are defaulted the same way as methods 
written in apps, including flow policy inference.  
(See the defaulting section, \secref{sec:system:defaults}.) 

Any method, constructor, or field  not written in the stub files or found in source code is not defaulted normally. 
 Instead,  all locations except final fields are default to \<@Source(ANY) @Sink(ANY)>.  
 (Final fields are defaulted to \<@Source(\{\})>.)
 This way, if such an API method is used, a type error
  will occur and alert the user to review and annotate the method. 
  A tool, discussed in Section \ref{flow-task-annotate-apis}, issues a warning every time a type declared in a 
  library that does not appear in a stub file is used.  This tool also outputs a list of declarations missing from
  the stub files. 
 
\section{Stricter tests\label{sec:stricter}}

By default, the Information Flow Checker is unsound.  After getting the basic checks to pass, the
 stricter checks should be enabled, by running \<ant -Dsound=true check-flow>.
This two-phase approach was chosen to reduce
the annotation effortand to give two separate phases of
the annotation effort.
 The sound checking enforces invariant 
array subtyping and type safety in downcasts.


When strict checks are turned on,
a cast \<(Object []) x>, were \<x> is of type \<Object>, will result
in a compiler warning:

\begin{alltt}
[jsr308.javac] ... warning: "@Sink @Source({ANY}) Object"
       may not be casted to the type "@Sink @Source Object"
\end{alltt}

The reason is that there is not way for the type-checker to verify
 the component type of the array. There is no static knowledge about the actual
runtime values in the array and important flow could be hidden.
The analyst should argue why the downcast is safe.

Note that the main qualifier of a cast is automatically flow-refined
by the cast expression.


\medskip

Stricter checking also enforces invariant array subtyping, which is
needed for sound array behavior in the absence of runtime checks.
Flow inference automatically refines the type of array creation
expressions depending on the left-hand side.
