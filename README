This is SPARTA!
Static Program Analysis for Reliable Trusted Apps.

See the output of "ant -p" for the build and test targets.
See build.properties for configuration variables.
If the other projects are in the default locations, you should
only need to set the android.home property or ANDROID_HOME
environment variable, e.g. by:

ant -Dandroid.home=... jar

See file docs/sparta-annotation.txt for further build and usage
instructions.

The Jenkins integration server for all projects is at:

http://buffalo.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/SPARTA/

The project is hosted at:

http://types.cs.washington.edu/sparta/

with the hidden releases at:

http://types.cs.washington.edu/sparta/releases/

To make a release, update build.properties with the new version number
and the version number of the Checker Framework; build sparta.jar;
edit the files in directory "website" and "website/release/" and
put sparta.jar and a zip-file of the repository into the "release"
directory.
Put these files online at
