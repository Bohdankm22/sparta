1. Download Ubuntu Desktop ISO - This may take a while (~700mb)
   Location: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/
   
2. Download /Install VirtualBox VM for your selected HOST platform.  
  a. Download VirtualBox for your HOST platform at: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
  	 Remember: Host platform is YOUR operating system and GUEST operating system is the one your installing.
  b. Install: Installation should be straightforward (most likely just double click on the icon) 
  	          and similar to any other program.

3.  Open VirtualBox and create VM
	a. Open Virtual Box
	b. Click New
	c. Using the Wizard, create a VM with the following settings:
		1. VMName = "SPARTA" (or at least that's what I used")
		   Operating System = 
		   		Type = Linux
		   		Version = Ubuntu(64 bit)
		2. Base Memory (Amount of RAM Devoted to the VM): I put 2 gigs, I will revisit this after
		installing it.
		3. Create a Virtual Hard Disk - 
			a. I created a VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) - I am not sure of the differences
			b. I used a 16GB dynamically allocated drive (it grows but doesn't shrink based on
			   usage, we should revisit this when we have an idea of how much we should use)
			   NOTE: I used 8GB for the hard drive and it was too small to install everything.
			c. Accept the settings and create the drive.
		4. Accept the drive you just created as the Virtual Hard Disk and create the VM.

4. Install Install 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) DESKTOP edition on the VM
	a.  Click on the SPARTA VM and press start.
	b.  Since this is the first time the VM has run it will open a wizard that will ask
	    you to select a "MEDIA SOURCE", use the ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso you
	    downloaded in STEP 1.
	c.  Press Continue Then Start.
	d.  This will cause the VM to boot from the disk image(ISO), follow the wizard using
	    these options:
		1.  Press Install Ubuntu
		2.  I selected download updates while installing, though I don't think it is necessary
			and I do think it added 5-10 minutes to the install process!
			press continue
		3.  Select Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu
		4.  There should be only one Disk to choose, you're VDI installed in STEP 3.c.4 (mine has VBOX) in the name
			Press "Install Now"
		5.  Select Seattle as you're location.
		6.  Select US English as your language/keyboard layout
		7.  Choosing a name:
			I chose SPARTA as my name, which automatically used the following settings:
			Machine Name: sparta-VirtualBox
			username: sparta
		8.  Choosing a password:
			I chose "ThisIsSparta!" and used the "Log in automatically option"
		9.  Pressing continue will begin the installation which will take 5-15 minutes (despite
			the progress bar's consistent and informative message of "14s remaining")
		10. Restart the VM when it's finished (there will be a "Restart" button)
		11. When it says: "Please remove the installation disk from the tray and press Enter"
			just press Enter.
			
5. Downloading and Installing Sparta
	a. Install Mercurial: sudo apt-get install mercurial
	b. cd ~/Documents
	c. mkdir sparta
	d. cd sparta
	e. I checked out sparta using git over ssh using the following command:
	   hg clone ssh://jburke@coco//projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/sparta-code/ sparta-code
	   hg clone ssh://jburke@coco//projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/sparta-subjects/ sparta-subjects
	   Note: the second / after coco is important to make the path relative to the root
	   and not your home directory.
	f. Install ant:
	   sudo apt-get install ant
	g. build the docs.(The directions below are based on the README in the docs folder),
	   make sure they haven't changed since I wrote this (see date above)
	   you should already have mercurial installed from earlier steps
		1. sudo apt-get install dia
		2. sudo apt-get install texlive-font-utils  //GET A COFFEE AND PLAY SOME TETRIS
		3. sudo apt-get install hevea
		4. sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base
		5. sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
		6. sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra //more coffee, 450mb
		7. sudo apt-get install ant-contrib
		8. cd docs
		9. make
	h.  After you have built the docs follow the instructions in manual.html
	    Note: See the file HowToInstallJava if you can't figure out how to install Java
	    on Ubuntu.  With possible alternative: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
	    I put all the paths in .bashrc, is this ok?
	    Had to add jsr308 prop to build.xml?
	    Todo Remove the hardcode of sparta?
	    Make sure after you download the Android SDK you go to the tools folder and do an actual
	    install, ./Android sdk
	    678 - 2:00PM
	    
	    IMPORTANT: YOU MUST HAVE:
		sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
	    in order to run parts of the android SDK
