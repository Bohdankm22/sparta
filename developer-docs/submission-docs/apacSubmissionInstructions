Downloading and Uploading To apac.fivedirections.com

/homes/gws/jburke/sparta

1.  Email Jonathan and get the private key/password for the server at apac.fivedirections.com.  
Before you can download to or upload from APAC you must have the SPARTA id_rsa private key (2048 bit sshv2) and password.  The private key, public key, and password were generated according to the instructions that can be found at:  /projects/swlab1/darpa-apac/apac-downloads/APACFileTransferInstructions.pdf
The private key and password can be found in /homes/gws/jburke/sparta but are readable only by Jonathan (email jburke@cs.washington.edu to get the keys/password).  Suzanne also has a copy.  (smillst@cs.washington.edu)

2.  There are two ways to login with the private key:
    2.a - Move it to your ~/.ssh
        2.a.1 If you don't have a ~/.ssh directory:
              mkdir ~/.ssh
              chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    
        2.a.2 Login via:
              sftp -P 4264 sparta@apac.fivedirections.com 
    
    2.b - Use the -i option
        2.b.1 Login via:
              sftp -P 4264 -i /path/to/private/key/id_rsa sparta@apac.fivedirections.com 
              
3.  You will be prompted to enter your password.  This password can be found at the bottom of the file id_rsaGenLog_wPassword.txt which will be given to you along with the private key by Jonathan.  Enter your password at the prompt to log in.

4.  To submit files (when you are already logged in via sftp):
    cd incoming
    //use put or mput to transfer files to the incoming directory
    //remember to use lcd to cd into the appropriate local directory
    //If you are submitting a binary please submit a checksum as well.
    //openssl dgst -sha256 SPARTA-1BDocs.zip > Checksum_SPARTA_1BDocs.txt

5.  To download files (when you are already logged in via sftp):
    cd outgoing
    //use get or mget to download files to your local directory
    //remember to use lcd to cd into the appropriate local directory
    
Remember:
incoming contains files that are being submitted (i.e. from us)
outgoing contains files to download (i.e. to us)
