----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7, 16 Oct 2012

Added more API annotations for Android and JDK libraries, in file flow.astub.
  Such annotations are necessary for any API that an app uses.  By
  expanding the SPARTA-provided set, the user has less work to do.
  flow.astub now contains over 1600 annotated methods (APIs).

Rewrote parts the SPARTA manual, notably Chapter 4, "Flow Checker".
  The description of the flow type system is clearer, with additional examples.
  Some material that was redundant with the Checker Framework manual has
  been replaced by a cross-reference to the Checker Framework manual, so
  that users can look just one place for authoritative information.
  Defaulting is more clearly explained.
  A new	chapter 5 details what an app developer is required to do in order
  to have the app approved.  For example, source code obfuscation is not
  permitted, and each warning suppression must be justified.

Use version 1.4.2 instead of 1.4.0 of the Checker Framework.
  SPARTA is built on the Checker Framework.  The detailed changes (mostly
  bug fixes and refactorings, but also a few new features) appear in
  the Checker Framework changelog at
