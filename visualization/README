The names of the data files are "API Graph Data.json" and "Flow Graph
Data.json".

The visualization files don't work in Firefox for some reason; they work in
Safari and Chrome. If using Chrome, you must launch Chrome with the
command-line argument --allow-file-access-from-files in order to let Chrome
allow local HTML files to read local files.
